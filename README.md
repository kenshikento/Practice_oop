## About
Redoing this legendary project that i did couple years ago which is a pretty simple project based on ShopCart Application. Taking from some inspiration from Laravel i tried making it a bit more from scratch.

## Setting Up

### Requirements
- Use PHP 7.3




## Running Tests [Unit Testing] 

### Customer Model [Mocking The Request With Symfony Request]
- Run `./vendor/bin/phpunit Test/Unit/Model/CustomerModelTest.php  ` to make sure you have the right database details

### TODO:
- Finish off Models 
- Add in necessary validation involved
- create controllers and handle custom routing
- Figure way to return data to controller to the view
- do simple front view
